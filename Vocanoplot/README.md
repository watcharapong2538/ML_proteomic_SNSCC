Methodology

    Data Preparation
    First, the necessary libraries are loaded to handle data manipulation, plotting, and exporting high-resolution images. The libraries used include ggplot2 for plotting, jpeg for exporting images, and grid and gridExtra for managing graphical objects.

    Data Import and Transformation
    The data for the volcano plot, Vocanolplot.input, is imported and converted into a data frame. A new column threshold is added to the data frame to classify the data points based on their fold change and p-value. Data points with an absolute fold change greater than 1.5 and a p-value less than 0.05 are categorized separately.
    # Import data and convert to data frame 
      Vocanoplot <- data.frame(Vocanolplot.input) 
    # Add threshold column based on fold change and p-value criteria Vocanoplot$threshold <- as.factor(abs(Vocanoplot$FC) > 1.5 & Vocanoplot$P.value <0.05)

    Data Preparation for Plotting
    The data is prepared for plotting by creating a new data frame df containing the log-transformed p-values and fold change values
    # Prepare data for plotting
      df <- data.frame(log10p.value = -log10(Vocanoplot$P.value), FC = Vocanoplot$FC)

    Volcano Plot Creation
    A volcano plot is created using ggplot2, where the x-axis represents the fold change, and the y-axis represents the -log10 transformed p-values. The data points are colored based on the threshold column to distinguish significant points
    # Create volcano plot
      GG <- ggplot(df, aes(x = FC, y = log10p.value, colour = Vocanoplot$threshold)) +
      geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 2) +
      theme(legend.position = "none") +
      xlab("Fold change") +
      ylab("-log10 p-value")
    # Display plot
      print(GG)

    Data Export
    The modified data frame, which includes the threshold column, is saved to a file for further analysis or record-keeping.
    # Save the modified data to a file
      write.table(Vocanoplot, "/path/to/output.txt", sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE)

    High-Resolution Image Export
    The volcano plot is exported as a high-resolution JPEG image using the jpeg library to ensure high-quality visual representation.
    # Export plot as a high-resolution image
      jpeg(height = 2500, width = 2000, file = "/path/to/vocanoplot.jpeg", res = 500)
      print(GG)
      dev.off()
